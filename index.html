    <h2>Descrição</h2>
    <p>
        With this recipe, you can enjoy restaurant-quality Steak Frites at the homestead. You'll love this inexpensive cut; it turns out as tender as filet mignon and as flavorful as ribeye. 
        "Butcher (or hanger) steak is great pan cooked, broiled, or grilled," says Chef John. "
    </p>

    <p>
        It takes to marinades wonderfully, and really can be substituted for any cut of steak. Just be sure to take the time to trim it well."
